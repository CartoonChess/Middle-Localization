# Middle-Localization

Middle is a macOS app that's made specifically to provide middle click functionality to the Apple Magic Mouse and trackpads.

The app is closed source, but here are the localization files. It's obvious that I've used machines for the translations. If you fix more than a few lines of translations, I will give you a free license for the app (or a refund if you've already purchased it).
